**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Following the project's checklist a variety of different technologies were used in the completion of this project.

These include following the BEM methodology and structure for HTML and CSS. Semantics are a vital piece of this project in that it allows us to understand what the purpose or role the HTML or CSS code may have. For example, the usage of header. footer, main, and section tags.

Fonts were connected using @font-face queries found in inter.css file and placed into it's own font.css file.

Media queries are used so that the layout is maintained at all resolutions meaning there is no horizontal scrolling and the overall look of the page is as it should be at different sizes. Text doesn't overflow and instead shows ellipsis.

Links have :hover state and <img> elements have alt attributes.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
